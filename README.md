# Dictionary
A small project on simple modern internet abbrv.
1. Gives a random abbrv if you are unsure.
2. Also tries matching mis-spelling, showing alternate word
3. The program is taking few time to load. 


## Things to keep in mind
1. Always write *readable code* in Python 

## Additional ideas to work on

- [] Make a TUI (Terminal User Interface) Application for the Dictionary
Python package that can be used: `blessed`: https://github.com/jquast/blessed
- [ ] Make a GUI Application for the Dictionary
Python package that can be used: `tkinter` : https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
- [ ] Implement the `get_close_matches()` on your own rather than importing it
